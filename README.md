# GettingANDCleaningData

# Description of Coursera project
This repository hosts the R code run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md, this Readme.md file and the tidy data set producing
which is actually the objective of this project.

The dataset being used is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:  [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

# Files related with this project
* run_analysis.R is an R script which reads the data set and follows five-step strategy (as desired in the course porject)
to come up with tidy data set.
* CodeBook.md is a code book which explains all the variables in the data set including their specifications.
* tidydata is the transformed data derived from the initial data

# Steps to run the Code

Download the data files from
